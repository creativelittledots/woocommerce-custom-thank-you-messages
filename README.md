## WooCommerce Custom Thank You Messages

WooCommerce Custom Thank You Messages extends Woocommerce and allows you to set the Thank You Messages on the Order Received Page for each Order Status.

Usually, to add a custom message on the Thank You page for each possible Order Status, you need to write code, well not anymore!

## How it works

Got to **WooCommerce > Settings > Messages** and write some text into one of the Statuses you'd like to test with.

![Example 1](screenshots/example-1.png?raw=true "Example 1")

Now go and checkout, make sure you use a Payment Method that will result in the Order Status you just wrote the message for.

![Example 2](screenshots/example-2.png?raw=true "Example 2")

Voila!
